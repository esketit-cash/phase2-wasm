## Project structure

* `webpack.config.js` config that is used to build .wasm and other project files
* `phase2-bn254/phase2` trusted setup crate, we build .wasm module from it
* `js/index.js` main frontend script that calls .wasm to generate the contribution
* `static/index.html` empty index file that just includes .js
* `static/params.bin` example previous contribution

This example uses static previous contribution file and outputs new contribution to console. On prod this should be handled by the server.
